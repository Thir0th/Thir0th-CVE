# Tenda AC23_V16.03.07.52 has a stack overflow in /goform/setMacFilterCfg through the parameter deviceList

## Basic Information

Vulnerability manufacturer: Shenzhen Jixiang Tenda Technology Co., Ltd.

Vulnerability level: high risk

Manufacturer's official website: https://www.tenda.com.cn

Affected object type: network equipment

Affected product: Tenda AC23

Affected product version: Tenda AC23_V16.03.07.52

Is it a product component vulnerability: No



## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Tenda AC23 is a wireless router from China's Tenda company.

Tenda AC23 has a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the parameter deviceList in the file /goform/setMacFilterCfg to correctly verify the length of the input data. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## 2. Vulnerability Details

Ida analyzes the binary file /bin/httpd and can see that the macFIlterType parameter passes through the parameter, while the deviceList parameter has no detection

This parameter will eventually be used as the first parameter of sub_46C940 and strcpyed to the stack. Since there is no detection, the attacker can overflow the stack, control the return address or construct a ROP chain getshell

gdb cannot test the offset due to the lack of symbol table. If the offset is tested, getshll can be used to cause greater damage
