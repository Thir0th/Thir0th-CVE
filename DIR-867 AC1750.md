There is a stack overflow vulnerability in prog.fcgi of D-Link DIR-867 A1 firmware 1.00B07. An attacker can construct an overlong REQUEST_URI or method= parameter in QUERY_STRING and use the difference (v38 - v34) between the starting position (v34) after method= and the & position (v38) to control the input length and trigger the overflow. strncpy copies the input to a 256-byte stack buffer, which lacks a length limit and may overwrite stack variables or return addresses. Although the firmware cannot be locally simulated and it is difficult to verify whether a shell can be obtained, the stack overflow is sufficient to cause the program to crash and cause service abnormalities.

The second vulnerability
D-Link DIR-867 A1 firmware 1.00B07 has a missing null terminator vulnerability in prog.fcgi. When processing the method= parameter, strncpy copies the 254-byte input to the 256-byte stack buffer, which lacks a null terminator, causing bstrdupNoBalloc to read out of bounds and cause a crash. An attacker can remotely trigger it through an HTTP POST request (such as method=AAA...A, 254 bytes), using the 8KB input limit of Lighttpd, causing a denial of service, and even further exploitation
